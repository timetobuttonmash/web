<p> Tomoya: (It’s not just that you’ve lost your memories—Your whole personality has changed.)
<br>
(Or could this be who you really are when everything else is stripped away, when you’re not acting at all?)
<br>
[another hour later]
<br>
Tomoya: (Urgh… I wasn’t able to ignore how hungry I was and ended up cooking with the ingredients in the fridge.)
<br>
(I’m so sorry, whoever lives here. I’ll come back later to pay you back for what I used—and the gas, too.)
<br>
(It’s not like I can do anything else, but I still feel guilty, like I’m doing something wrong…)
<br>
(Well, we are let’s see… trespassing, squatting, and eating their food—stealing. Yup, those are all crimes.)
<br>
(But! It was an emergency! I had no choice!)
<br>
Wataru: ? What’s wrong, Tomoya-kun?
<br>
Tomoya: Oh um, nothing… It’s just a little ridiculous how I keep trying to drag common sense into these kinds of completely nonsensical situations.
<br>
Wataru: …?
<br>
Tomoya: Aaanyway, you should eat before it gets cold. Dig in~ ♪
<br>
Wataru: Hmm. Dig in…? (1)
<br>
Tomoya: Yeah, yeah—You know like, eat up!
<br>
Wataru: I see. Ummm, and is this how I use these utensils? Bring the sticks together?
<br>
Tomoya: You haven’t forgotten that, have you? When you were helping me cook, you could use the knives and the microwave oven just fine.
<br>
So you should still remember everything you learned through muscle memory. So maybe you’re just missing your—what’s it called, episodic memory?
<br>
Wataru: Oh, I see!
<br>
Tomoya: Uh, but I’m just kinda saying stuff; I only know a little bit about this, so don’t like, quote me on it or anything…
<br>
Wataru: Even still, you have much more knowledge than I do, Tomoya-kun. Because I’ve forgotten everything ♪
<br>
Tomoya: Right… You’re really counting on me, huh.
<br>
Wataru: Yes. If I’m behaving strangely, please point it out to me and I’ll fix it.
<br>
Tomoya: No um, for you it’s more like, the more normal you act, the weirder it is.
<br>
Wataru: Hm? Is that really the kind of person I was?
<br>
Tomoya: Ngh~… Maybe you’ll remember something if I tell you some of our memories together one by one? But I kinda have a crappy memory.
<br>
Wataru: Yes, that would be a big help. You’re a very nice boy, Tomoya-kun.
<br>
Tomoya: Nah, anyone would try to help out if someone they knew had amnesia…
<br>
I really wanna take you to a doctor, but that monster is still running around so I’m scared to go outside.
<br>
Wataru: I still don’t know what you mean by monster.
<br>
Tomoya: If you’re so curious, go look for yourself. You can see it from the window—It’s been wandering around the apartment for a while now.
<br>
Wataru: Is it normal for monsters such as that one to walk around? It seems a bit strange, don’t you think?
<br>
Tomoya: No, it’s totally impossible. Maybe I’m still sleeping and this is all just a dream?
<br>
I don’t get this at all. But y’know, I’ve heard stuff about other units being trapped in deserts and jungles and stuff.
<br>
This year’s SS is just weird all around.
<br>
Wataru: SS…?
<br>
Tomoya: Oh, I probably have to explain that, too. Man, what a pain. Can you cut it out if you’re just putting on a show, Hibiki-senpai?
<br>
Wataru: I don’t know what to tell you. I truly don’t remember anything.
<br>
I’m sorry for all the trouble I’m causing you, Tomoya-kun.
<br>
Tomoya: No, there’s nothing you need to apologize for.
<br>
(Ngh~… I’m all over the place. No matter what horrible things you put me through, you always had that damn smile on your face like you were having the time of your life.)
<br>
(But now you’re weirdly… dignified, or I guess mature…? It’s not just that you’ve lost your memories—Your whole personality has changed.)
<br>
(Or could this be who you really are when everything else is stripped away, when you’re not acting at all?)
<br>
Wataru: Um, Tomoya-kun.
<br>
Tomoya: What is it… Sorry if you didn’t like the food, I’m not really much of a cook.
<br>
Wataru: No, it was delicious. Just sitting around the table with someone else is enough to make me happy.
<br>
Tomoya: Oh yeah, you basically never eat in front of people, do you?
<br>
Wataru: Is that right? Hm, I see. I’m learning ♪
<br>
Tomoya: …Anyway, didn’t you have something to say to me?
<br>
Wataru: Yes, I was wondering about something.
<br>
What is this thing wrapped around our wrists?
<br>
Tomoya: Oh… It’s a device—a watch-type thing? I don’t really know much about it.
<br>
It was given out to everyone about half a month ago, when the SS qualifiers started.
<br>
I was told that if you keep it on, you’ll earn SSL$ proportional to the time you’ve worn it.
<br>
I guess it’s some kind of experiment they’re doing, but I’m not really sure what they’re aiming for.
<br>
It doesn’t look like it can hurt you, and you get money just by wearing it, and that’s pretty win-win… So I haven’t taken it off.
<br>
But as for what it is? Yeah, I don’t know. There’s a little screen on it, but it doesn’t display anything.
<br>
Wataru: No, there’s been some text on the… screen? of the watch? for a while now.
<br>
Tomoya: Huh? Wha—You’re right! I didn’t even notice!
<br>
Ah, crap~ When I’ve got my mind focused on one thing, I can’t pay attention to anything else.
<br>
Okay umm, you said it was some text—
<br>
Oh no, it’s English… Ngh~ What does it say?
<br>
Wataru: “Welcome to SANCTUARY”—
<br>
Tomoya: Uh, huh? You can read this, Hibiki-senpai?
<br>
Wataru: Yes. Though usually… It’s strange that you can read even without your memory. Does that mean I haven’t forgotten the skills I’ve learned?
<br>
Umm, let’s see. It means… Well, a sanctuary is a place of refuge, a holy ground… correct? (2)
<br>
Tomoya: Nngh~? What’s that supposed to mean? This just keeps getting weirder and weirder…!
